## Our Sauce 
We partner students with a mentor for a six-week program that encourages students to exercise agency in their career.

### Building a Brighter Future
The magic of the program happens in the weekly career circle calls.  Ideally, students are leading and facilitating these circles themselves.  In practice, volunteers are often guiding early sessions encouraging students to engage deeper so that they get to the purpose of the week. 

We believe in promoting a mindset of resilience, a determined work ethic, and the transparent sharing of knowledge. Empowering students with these principles, we help them network into their first job.

### What do we do? — Help students to transform their lives and find their career path
To help students translate interest into a career, we pair students with a mentor.  We encourage students to shape their job search to reflect their own interests as well as market signal.  Through a program of eight meetings we try to shape student perspectives across their job search. 

The Career Circle program is structured according to the applicant journey: Self-Assessment, Research and Exploration, Resume and Preparation, Networking, Job Applications, Interviews, Follow-up, and Negotiations.  The focus for each meeting is small group discussions.  Short videos and exercises help set context.  Options are provided to dive deeper through with additional resources. 

### Why are we doing this? — Higher education can be expensive, but the benefits are worth it
We strongly believe that investing in students means investing in a better world. Through scholarships, training, and various services, we support college students. By helping students pursue their educational dreams, we're creating a brighter future—for both them and our communities. Together, we strive to build a fair and equal society where everyone can reach their fullest potential.

## What Students Are Saying
>As I approached graduation and began preparing for my career, I realized I was struggling with how to effectively search for jobs and present myself during interviews. I felt overwhelmed by the process and unsure of the best strategies to stand out to employers. I needed guidance on how to navigate the job market more confidently—specifically with resume-building, job search techniques, and interview preparation. My mentor took the time to walk me through effective job search methods, including how to tailor my applications for specific roles. He also helped me improve my interviewing skills through mock interviews and personalized feedback. My mentor shared resources, examples, and tips that were practical and easy to apply. Thanks to his support, I gained a lot more confidence in my job search. I now have a clear strategy for applying to positions that fit my goals, and I feel prepared to handle interviews professionally. His mentorship made a real difference in helping me feel career-ready.

>As a college senior, I am preparing to graduate and enter the job market. I felt overwhelmed by finding a full-time job and was unsure where to start. My goal was to secure a full-time position before graduation in May, but I needed guidance on how to successfully navigate the job search process. My mentor helped me learn the importance of networking and interview processes. He also gave me feedback on my personal brand. I gained more confidence in my abilities and in navigating the job market. I have a few interviews coming up, and I am confident they will go smoothly because of this mentor.

>My experience with my career mentor has been incredibly valuable in shaping my job search strategy. When I first started exploring marketing and advertising, I felt overwhelmed by the vast range of opportunities and unsure how to position myself effectively. I needed guidance on refining my portfolio, identifying the right roles, and building confidence in my skills. My mentor made insightful observations about my strengths and market trends, helping me see where I could stand out. He provided personalized advice on optimizing my resume, improving my social media marketing approach, and developing a strategic job search plan. His recommendations, along with connections to industry professionals and practical resources, made the process much more manageable. As a result, I gained clarity, secured interviews for roles aligned with my interests, and approached job searching with a newfound sense of confidence and direction.

>One of my challenges that I faced was that I could not land interviews with companies that I was very interested in. I asked my mentor how to better myself and be more noticeable. My mentor told me to reach out to people in the companies that I’m interested in and to connect with them on LinkedIn. I immediately tried it with one company, HubSpot, and conveniently got an interview with them! The first one already happened and now I am onto the second round! I truly thank you, my mentor!

>My mentor was very helpful with describing our objectives in real-world situations. He challenged us to network with our group outside of class to learn more about each other. This allowed us to have effective discussions with one another when the floor was open to talk. I personally needed help learning more about the differences in B2B and B2C and what to do when you work with both types of clients. With his marketing background, he helped me understand how to market effectively. My mentor took many steps to reach out to people he knew in different industries and help us make a connection. Our grit circle was very positive and helped us grow our professionalism.
