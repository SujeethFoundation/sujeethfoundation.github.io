We share stories to inspire and educate.  We hope students can leverage this experience in their own journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many college juniors, the uncertainty of what comes next can be overwhelming. You might be wondering if your major is the right fit, how to land your first job, or whether the twists and turns of your journey will lead to success. To offer some inspiration, we’re sharing the story of Britt Hall—a professional who carved out a fulfilling career by embracing change, saying “yes” to opportunities, and staying true to their values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britt Hall’s career has been a journey of transformation, adaptability, and storytelling. She began in journalism, leading student newspapers and shaping narratives that connected communities. That passion for communication and culture led her into corporate environments, where she built internal communications strategies, fostered engagement, and helped organizations navigate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Whole Foods Market, Britt played a key role in launching the 365 brand, designing team member experiences and driving internal culture. At National Instruments, she partnered with senior leaders to implement large-scale transformation and modern workplace initiatives. Now, at Cisco, she leads global enablement efforts, ensuring talent strategies empower people and teams to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through every step, Britt’s work has been shaped by three guiding values: authenticity, accountability, and creative problem-solving. She remains dedicated to building meaningful experiences that drive impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-first-steps-a-nonlinear-college-journey&quot;&gt;The First Steps: A Nonlinear College Journey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britt Hall’s college experience wasn’t a straight path. In fact, it took nearly seven years to complete a bachelor’s degree. Initially pursuing music education and performance, Britt found themselves on an expected trajectory—until a single elective, “Storytelling and Puppetry,” reshaped their perspective. That class ignited a passion for storytelling, leading to a major shift into journalism and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching from a music program meant starting over, even taking a step back to community college before transferring again on a journalism scholarship. These experiences taught Britt valuable lessons in resilience, adaptability, and trusting one’s instincts—skills that would prove crucial in their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-first-job-freelance-hustle-and-saying-yes&quot;&gt;The First Job: Freelance, Hustle, and Saying Yes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britt’s first job after college wasn’t handed to them—it was built through experience and opportunity. While freelancing for the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, Britt wore many hats: general assignments reporter, copy editor, and even interim archivist. At the same time, they worked as a barista, eventually taking on training and marketing roles for the coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months after graduation, Britt secured their first full-time role in marketing and communications for the Corpus Christi Symphony Orchestra—an opportunity that came from an earlier internship. The key lesson? Keep doors open, maintain good relationships, and recognize that every experience (even in retail and food service) builds skills that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-career-built-on-passion-and-adaptability&quot;&gt;A Career Built on Passion and Adaptability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, Britt leads a global team at Cisco, managing employee experience and enablement for hiring and internal talent movement programs. It’s a role that aligns almost perfectly with their Ikigai—the Japanese concept of purpose—combining passion, mission, vocation, and profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britt’s journey from journalism to corporate leadership wasn’t accidental. It was guided by a mindset of embracing change, being willing to “figure it out,” and leveraging past experiences to build a unique and valuable career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;advice-for-college-juniors-be-a-bricoleur&quot;&gt;Advice for College Juniors: Be a Bricoleur&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what advice does Britt have for students entering the workforce?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say yes now, figure it out later.&lt;/strong&gt; Opportunities don’t always come neatly packaged. Trust yourself enough to take on challenges, even when you don’t feel fully prepared.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build resilience.&lt;/strong&gt; The most adaptable and successful people share three traits: accepting reality, finding meaning in what they do, and improvising when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify your values early.&lt;/strong&gt; Britt’s guiding principles—authenticity, accountability, and creative problem-solving—help in making decisions, setting boundaries, and maintaining work-life balance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep relationships strong.&lt;/strong&gt; The first full-time job came from an internship, and career growth often hinges on connections and a strong reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-takeaway-your-path-is-yours-to-make&quot;&gt;The Takeaway: Your Path is Yours to Make&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britt Hall’s career isn’t one of rigid planning—it’s a testament to adaptability, lifelong learning, and saying “yes” to the right opportunities. For college juniors feeling uncertain, the message is clear: your path doesn’t have to be linear. Trust the journey, embrace change, and build a career that aligns with your passions and strengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As students begin to navigate the bridge between academics and career aspirations, it can feel like an overwhelming journey. Questions about the right first job, long-term goals, and personal fulfillment often weigh heavily on students. That’s why we’re thrilled to spotlight &lt;strong&gt;Valerie Bergman&lt;/strong&gt;, a Field Sales Specialist for Data and AI in Azure at Microsoft, whose career journey offers both inspiration and practical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valerie Bergman’s career spans over 20 years, from starting as a software engineer to becoming a Data &amp;amp; AI Specialist at Microsoft. Along the way, she led IT strategy at Avtex Solutions, guided enterprise customers as a technology strategist, and now helps businesses innovate with AI and data solutions. Her journey reflects a focus on solving problems, driving innovation, and mentoring future STEM leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;aligning-passion-with-profession&quot;&gt;Aligning Passion with Profession&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerie’s current role at Microsoft combines her technical expertise with her passion for helping others. She thrives on solving complex problems and helping her customers justify their investments in innovation. Her journey exemplifies the Japanese concept of &lt;strong&gt;Ikigai&lt;/strong&gt;, or “reason for being,” as she’s managed to align her passion, mission, vocation, and profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valerie’s story is a testament to the importance of finding work that resonates deeply with your skills and values. She believes that career success isn’t just about the “how” but about understanding the “&lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;”—a lesson that has guided her throughout her career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valerie’s career began as a software engineer for a consulting company, where she developed custom software. This experience was pivotal in shaping her career trajectory. “I learned so much about technology in school, but my first job kickstarted my passion for understanding business requirements and opportunities,” Valerie recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of her key takeaways from this early experience was the importance of focusing on &lt;strong&gt;why, who, and what&lt;/strong&gt; before jumping into the &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;. “Too often, failure happens because the ‘why’ is not fully understood,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;strategies-that-work&quot;&gt;Strategies That Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing her first job was no accident. Valerie credits a combination of &lt;strong&gt;networking&lt;/strong&gt;, building an &lt;strong&gt;online brand&lt;/strong&gt;, and leveraging &lt;strong&gt;job postings&lt;/strong&gt; as strategies that helped her break into the tech industry. Her experience underscores the importance of being proactive and using multiple approaches when job hunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lessons-from-the-journey&quot;&gt;Lessons from the Journey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerie’s career journey has been shaped by valuable insights and mindset shifts, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always seek to understand &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; before tackling how.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t shy away from failure; view it as a stepping stone, not a permanent setback.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep learning and stay curious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;college-experience-a-foundation-for-growth&quot;&gt;College Experience: A Foundation for Growth&lt;/h1&gt;

While working her way through school, she developed critical time-management skills and gained early career exposure. However, Valerie also emphasizes the importance of engaging with the &lt;strong&gt;social aspects of college life&lt;/strong&gt;, as these experiences help build networks and develop interpersonal skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;words-of-wisdom-for-the-next-generation&quot;&gt;Words of Wisdom for the Next Generation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerie’s advice for students is both simple and profound:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always have fun.&lt;/strong&gt; Find joy in what you do, no matter where you are in your career.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be courageous.&lt;/strong&gt; Take risks and lean into challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never compromise who you are.&lt;/strong&gt; Authenticity is key to long-term success.&lt;/li&gt;

We share stories to inspire and educate.  We hope students can leverage this experience in their own journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning your career might seem daunting, but learning from those who have navigated similar paths can be both inspiring and insightful. One such story is that of Laurel Dzneladze, a dynamic professional at Microsoft whose journey showcases the power of adaptability, networking, and continuous learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;finding-passion-through-experience&quot;&gt;Finding Passion Through Experience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurel currently supports the Microsoft Viva Community and communication products, focusing on product marketing and go-to-market strategies. Her passion lies in how community and communications shape an organization’s success. Throughout her career, she has dedicated herself to building solutions that drive engagement, productivity, and overall success within companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her career trajectory wasn’t a straight line, but each experience helped shape her professional path. Laurel’s story is proof that discovering your Ikigai—the intersection of passion, mission, vocation, and profession—takes time, experimentation, and a willingness to explore different opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;from-internship-to-full-time-success&quot;&gt;From Internship to Full-Time Success&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurel’s first job came as an extension of an internship at Johnson Controls, which transitioned into a full-time role after graduation. In this position, she was responsible for communicating large organizational changes and managing digital spaces like the company’s website and intranet.
Some of her most valuable lessons from this early experience included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding organizational processes&lt;/strong&gt;—how to start and complete a project effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing presentation and executive relationship skills&lt;/strong&gt;—key abilities that help in gaining visibility and trust.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborating in a corporate environment&lt;/strong&gt;—learning how to navigate teams and work cross-functionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;landing-the-first-job-a-lesson-in-proactive-networking&quot;&gt;Landing the First Job: A Lesson in Proactive Networking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Laurel secure her internship that led to her first job? It started with an unpaid marketing role at a performing arts foundation, where she dedicated just four hours a week. That experience gave her exposure to a network of professionals, including board members who later connected her with the internship opportunity at Johnson Controls.
Her journey highlights a crucial strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Start small, be proactive, and leverage networking opportunities. Even the smallest roles can lead to significant career breakthroughs when approached with the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;career-lessons-and-mindset-shifts&quot;&gt;Career Lessons and Mindset Shifts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout her career, Laurel has embraced a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability. Here are some of her key insights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share ideas early and often&lt;/strong&gt;—don’t be afraid to put your thoughts out there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask questions instead of disagreeing outright&lt;/strong&gt;—a great approach to constructive discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observe and learn from leadership&lt;/strong&gt;—find role models whose work ethic and leadership style resonate with you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look beyond your immediate team&lt;/strong&gt;—seek projects outside your role that expose you to new challenges and learning opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;embracing-a-nonlinear-path&quot;&gt;Embracing a Nonlinear Path&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurel’s college experience was anything but conventional. She started as a dance major in Kansas City, studied abroad for a year, then took time off before resuming college at 25 years old. She compressed 2.5 years of coursework into just 1.5 years, proving that determination and flexibility can reshape one’s academic and career path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unconventional journey reinforced an important lesson: careers are not always linear. The skills and experiences you gain from varied paths can become assets in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;advice-for-college-students&quot;&gt;Advice for College Students&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Laurel could give one piece of advice to students entering the workforce, it would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not every role needs to be your dream job, and not every company needs to be your dream company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s okay to change your mind about your career direction multiple times. What matters is gaining clarity on what excites you and where you want to grow after spending time in the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeaways for Your Career Journey
Laurel Dzneladze’s story is a testament to the power of &lt;strong&gt;persistence, adaptability, and strategic networking&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether you’re just starting out or rethinking your path, remember that &lt;strong&gt;every experience adds value&lt;/strong&gt;—even the unexpected ones. Your journey is uniquely yours, and with an open mind and proactive approach, you can carve a fulfilling and successful career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your next step?&lt;/strong&gt; Start small, be open to opportunities, and don’t be afraid to take the unconventional path—it might just lead you exactly where you need to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For college juniors preparing to launch their careers, the path ahead can feel both exciting and uncertain. How do you land that first job? What skills truly matter? How do you turn a job into a fulfilling career? To help answer these questions, we spoke with Dave D’Abate, a successful Account Executive whose career journey is proof that relationships, continuous learning, and adaptability are key ingredients for long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;starting-strong-lessons-from-the-first-job&quot;&gt;Starting Strong: Lessons from the First Job&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave’s career began at AT&amp;amp;T as a retail sales consultant. Like many fresh graduates, he started in an entry-level role, selling devices and services to both consumers and small business accounts. But what set him apart? His mindset. While others simply met expectations, Dave aimed higher—doubling his sales targets and positioning himself as a go-to resource and subject matter expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He quickly learned that success isn’t just about showing up; it’s about being proactive. “I had to put in the effort beyond what I witnessed from my colleagues,” he says. This willingness to go the extra mile became a defining trait in his career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;breaking-into-the-workforce-the-power-of-first-impressions&quot;&gt;Breaking into the Workforce: The Power of First Impressions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing that first job can be daunting, but Dave emphasizes the importance of energy, enthusiasm, and preparation. One piece of advice he received early on has stuck with him: “Every conversation you have is an interview.” From the very first screening call to the final handshake, the way you present yourself matters. Being able to articulate your work ethic and passion can make all the difference in standing out to hiring managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;building-a-career-key-lessons-and-mindset-shifts&quot;&gt;Building a Career: Key Lessons and Mindset Shifts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Dave has picked up several insights that have fueled his success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be willing to learn.&lt;/strong&gt; Taking the extra time to do something correctly now will set you up for success later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your business.&lt;/strong&gt; If something needs to get done, schedule time for it—otherwise, it won’t happen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability is key.&lt;/strong&gt; You won’t always succeed on the first try, but the ability to adjust and improve will make you stronger.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate feedback immediately.&lt;/strong&gt; When someone offers guidance, show them that their investment in you is worth it by implementing changes right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;from-college-to-career-the-importance-of-preparation&quot;&gt;From College to Career: The Importance of Preparation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave admits that he wasn’t the best student in college—he spent more time hiking than studying. But he quickly realized that preparation is everything. “Studying in college is very similar to how one should prepare before any meeting,” he explains. Whether it’s a class or a client presentation, showing up unprepared is never an option. Observing how others operate and borrowing their best practices can help you refine your own approach over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;final-advice-for-students-entering-the-workforce&quot;&gt;Final Advice for Students Entering the Workforce&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave’s parting wisdom for students is simple yet powerful: “Always set aside time to continue investing in your success.” Seek out mentors who are invested in your growth, absorb their knowledge, and apply it. But never stop learning—if you ever find yourself as the smartest person in the room, it’s time to find a different room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you chart your own career path, remember that success isn’t a straight line. It’s built on hard work, adaptability, and the relationships you nurture along the way. Take a page from Dave D’Abate’s journey, and embrace every opportunity to learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

In this spotlight, we introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/martatexidor/&quot;&gt;Marta Texidor&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated professional who has made a significant impact in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;meet-marta-texidor&quot;&gt;Meet Marta Texidor&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marta Texidor is currently the Director of Customer Success for Pharma and MedTech at Microsoft. Her career journey has been a remarkable one, driven by her passion for helping others achieve their goals and her unwavering commitment to personal growth. After initially interning as a software developer, she landed her first job as a software developer with Atos. Demonstrating her versatility, she later transitioned into a customer-facing role at Progress Software, honing her skills in customer relationships. Eventually, Marta found her calling at Microsoft, where she excelled as a Customer Success Manager, specializing in digital transformation within the Healthcare and Life Sciences sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-call-to-adventure-college-and-beyond&quot;&gt;The Call to Adventure: College and Beyond&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marta’s journey started like many college students, with a dream and a degree. She graduated with a degree in Computer Science engineering and a thirst for knowledge. Her first job while she was still at school was a unique one - she became a private Math tutor. While it may seem unrelated to her eventual career in the tech industry, this role challenged her to find creative ways to make complex concepts understandable. Each student had their unique learning style, and Marta’s adaptability helped her connect with them on a personal level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-info&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;
    &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;
    Lesson 1: The Power of Adaptability - In a world that often values binary thinking, Marta learned to embrace the ambiguity and explore the grey areas. She discovered that there is beauty in the in-between, where creativity and innovation thrive.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;navigating-the-path-to-her-dream-job&quot;&gt;Navigating the Path to Her Dream Job&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marta’s journey into the tech industry began with a simple conversation and networking. In a pre-internet era, personal connections mattered most. Through a friend’s mother, she secured her first job as a Java Developer. While she lacked experience, Marta’s attitude set her apart. She embraced the opportunity to learn and welcomed feedback as a means to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-info&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;
    &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;
    Lesson 2: Networking and Attitude Matter - Sometimes, it’s not about your experience but your eagerness to learn and your openness to feedback that can pave the way to success.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;embracing-diversity-in-college&quot;&gt;Embracing Diversity in College&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marta’s college experience played a crucial role in shaping her career. She attended a college that exposed her to a diverse range of people and cultures. This experience opened her mind to the beauty of diversity and the commonalities that bind us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In college, I realized we all have much more in common than we might think at first glance. Finding those connections points has now become one of my strengths, helping me grow in my career, partnering with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-info&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;
    &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;
    Lesson 3: Finding Strength in Diversity - Marta’s ability to find common ground with people from various backgrounds has become one of her strengths in her career. It has allowed her to connect with others, fostering a sense of belonging and creating meaningful partnerships.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;advice-for-aspiring-professionals&quot;&gt;Advice for Aspiring Professionals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marta leaves college students with a valuable piece of advice - there are no wrong turns, only unexpected paths. Your career journey may not follow a straight line, but what matters most is aligning your choices with your values. When you do that, everything else will fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My biggest shift in thinking, coming from an engineering background, was that not everything is 1s or 0s, black or white. There is beauty in the ambiguity and the grey areas. Because it is not as defined as the extremes, you can play and find your own path and framework to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion-your-journey-awaits&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Your Journey Awaits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you embark on your academic and career journey, remember Marta’s story. Embrace adaptability, network, maintain a positive attitude, and celebrate diversity. The Sujeeth Foundation encourages you to find your unique path, just as Marta did, and to view education as a tool and to embrace concepts from books like “Grit,” “Work Out Loud,” and “Mindset” to guide your way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.sujeeth.org/#whitepaper&quot;&gt;Download the whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. Her story serves as an inspiration for all aspiring professionals, reminding them that their career paths may take unexpected turns, but with the right mindset and determination, they can achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

We share stories to inspire and educate.  We hope students can leverage this experience in their own journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avi Sujeeth is a Director of the Sujeeth Foundation.  Avi worked for Microsoft for fifteen years in field sales roles like Customer Success Manager and Sales Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avi describes the underlying interest in his current job:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m passionate about the ability of technology to drive transformational change. I think the need in education and healthcare is prescient. We have a shortage in teaching and clinician talent. In addition, we are challenged to deliver better outcomes. Graduates should do work they are passionate about. Patients should be able to increase their life span. I think technology can help education institutions advance in research, promote new ways of learning, and deliver experiences in an unmatched way. In addition, I think technology can help health care organizations increase clinician productivity, engage with patients in new ways, and revolutionize how population health is managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avi Sujeeth began his academic journey like many of you, as a college student. He attended Washington University and, like most students, had his sights set on a specific career path, aiming for consulting or investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Avi graduated, he faced one of the most challenging job markets in recent history, marked by the fallout from the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy. He applied to countless companies, endured 30 interviews, and reached 10 final interviews before finally receiving one job offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Avi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think it was difficult because of the market situation and because I was trying to make a career transition - I was trying to get into strategic consulting or investment banking. I didn’t have a strong story around how my previous experiences had prepared me for those roles. In fact, when I did get a job it was with Microsoft sales. I was able to tell a story of how my financial experience, technology passion, and sales experience had prepared me to sell technology to finance departments in enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-info&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;
    &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;
    Lesson 1 - Building Your Narrative. Avi’s journey taught him the importance of crafting a compelling narrative about how his experiences had prepared him for a role. People hire you because they believe in your potential. Crafting a story that helps others understand your capabilities can make all the difference.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avi started his career as a Modern Work Solution Specialist at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was a sales role positioning Microsoft’s investments in SharePoint with clients. I didn’t really understand sales when I was first hired. I thought in order to be successful, a sales person had to out position the competition by maintaining control. I learned that sometimes you can get more success when you follow instead of leading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As his career advanced he has had over seven roles with four significant job transformations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I’ve mapped out my career, one of the hardest activities was to develop a career plan. I haven’t a traditional track into management. Instead, I’ve focused on solving difficult problems as an individual contributor leader. As I’ve mastered skills, I’ve looked to move into adjacent roles to increase my impact. I’ve used frameworks like the next, next job to think about skills or relationships I need to develop in my current role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-info&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;
    &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;
    Lesson 2 - Adaptability is Key. College students tend to envision success as linear, but Avi’s career demonstrates that adaptability is a key ingredient in success. Don’t be afraid to pivot, learn new skills, and explore adjacent roles to maximize your impact.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avi has published several blogs discussing his career path and how he aligns his career decisions with his core values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avi shares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve also spent time leveraging thinking about my core values and how they align to the career path I’m navigating. While I wouldn’t have predict my career path, it has been incredibly rewarding. I look forward to seeing how it continues to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-info&quot; role=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;
    &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-info-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;
    Lesson 3 - Aligning with Core Values.  Throughout his journey, Avi has consistently aligned his career decisions with his core values. Understanding what truly matters to you can guide your career choices, making your journey more fulfilling and purpose-driven.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you embark on your academic and career journey, remember that you have agency. You can shape your path, navigate challenges, and find purpose in unexpected places. The Sujeeth Foundation encourages you to view education as a tool, just as Avi did, and to embrace concepts from books like “Grit,” “Work Out Loud,” and “Mindset” to guide your way.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.sujeeth.org/#whitepaper&quot;&gt;Download the whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to providing funds, one of the goals of the foundation is to enrich the experience of every applicant.  To that end, welcome gifts, volunteering opportunities, community meetups and even the application for the scholarship itself – they are all targeted to help applicants build skills in Mindset, Grit, and Working Out Loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working Out Loud is a concept coined by John Stepper.  In today’s interconnected and fast-paced world, success is not solely determined by individual brilliance or expertise; it thrives on collaboration, community, and the power of networks. Enter “Work Out Loud” (WOL), a transformative approach that empowers professionals to harness the full potential of collaboration, share their work openly, and cultivate meaningful connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, WOL is a mindset and practice that encourages individuals to make their work visible, actively contribute to the success of others, and build purposeful networks. It is a departure from traditional silos and closed-door practices, ushering in a new era of transparency, generosity, and collective growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this digital age, where information flows freely and barriers to communication have diminished, the power of working out loud has become more evident than ever. By sharing our ideas, progress, and challenges with a wider audience, we tap into the collective intelligence of our networks and unlock opportunities for collaboration, feedback, and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, WOL is not just about broadcasting our work; it’s about building relationships that transcend geographical boundaries and professional hierarchies. It’s about finding like-minded individuals, diverse perspectives, and unexpected collaborations that fuel innovation and drive personal and organizational growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John even created a guide to help people facilitate their own work out loud circles.  I envision where a community will build around the Sujeeth Foundation and we will be able to connect applicants to each other as they strive to determine their passion and achieve their purpose.  To help with that community building I’ve gathered John’s guides in this blog post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-1.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 1: Attune your attention&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
In your first week, after getting to know your other Circle members a bit better, each of you will pick your own individual goal. Then you’ll take a step towards that goal by creating a “relationship list,” an initial list of people related to your goal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-2.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 2: Offer your first contributions&lt;/a&gt;
In Week 2, you’ll make simple contributions to people on your relationship list, deepening relationships in a small way. Just reviewing the list will further attune your attention to your goal, and the small steps you take each week will gradually increase your sense of empowerment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-3.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 3: Take three small steps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
In Week 3, you’ll make a simple adjustment to managing your time, you’ll add to your relationship list, and you’ll offer another kind of contribution. These small steps will help reinforce and expand your practice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-4.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 4: Earn someone else’s attention&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
How you present your contribution can make all the difference. This week, you’ll practice refining the way you write your messages and how you approach people in general. These exercises will make your contributions feel more personal and valuable, and more likely to be effective.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-5.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 5: Make it personal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Most people think far too narrowly about what they have to offer. This week can change that for you. The exercises will help you understand how the broad set of things you may take for granted - what makes you you - can serve as the basis for meaningful connections with others.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-6.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 6: Improve your visibility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
It’s hard for anyone to discover you and your work when you’re invisible. This week, to improve your chances of making connections, you’ll take a step towards improving your online presence. Then you’ll use your improved presence to deepen a relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-7.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 7: Be purposeful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This week, you’ll do one of the most powerful exercises in your Circle: “A letter from your future self.” By articulating a longer-term vision of what might be possible, you‘ll increase the chances of that vision becoming a reality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-8.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 8: Make it a habit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Although you’ve spent seven weeks thinking of your goal in terms of people and contributions, you’re still working on making it a habit and mindset. It’s natural, for example, to struggle with finding time to work your list or remembering to follow up. This week, you’ll explore ways to reinforce your new habit so it takes less effort and feels increasingly natural, and to overcome the inevitable challenges and setbacks. Then you’ll practice empathy (again) in a way that might surprise you - and will certainly distinguish you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-9.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 9: Explore more original contributions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
At this point in your Circle, you’re ready to further expand your range of contributions by making more of your work and thinking visible. Even if this is new to some of you or makes you uncomfortable, the exercises this week will help you take a step, allowing you to create something simple that’s also generous and useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-10.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 10: Become more systematic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Having a system can make things easier. This week, you’ll work with two simple systems, one for identifying new contributions and one for managing your relationship list. Then you’ll offer something which you may never have thought of as a contribution.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-11.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 11: Imagine the possibilities&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
So far, the focus has been on your individual contributions and connections. In Week 11, you’ll expand your sense of what’s possible by thinking more broadly about your network, your role in it, and what you might accomplish together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wol/wol-circle-guides-v4.5-week-12.pdf&quot;&gt;Week 12: Reflect and celebrate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
This final week marks the end of a process, and maybe a kind of beginning. You’ll reflect on what has changed for you and what might
come. In your last exercise, you’ll make several additional contributions, including some for yourself. Hold this final meeting over lunch or dinner if you can - or come up with some other creative way to create an environment that’s conducive to celebration&lt;/li&gt;

She reminds us that the path to finding our true calling requires more than just picking a job; it demands an open mind, an adventurous spirit, and a willingness to embrace unexpected opportunities. By exploring different career paths, understanding that passion can be developed, and aligning with our core values, we set the stage for a transformative journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your interests?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;interests are not discovered through introspection. Instead, interests are triggered by interactions with the outside world. The process of interest discovery can be messy, serendipitous, and inefficient. This is because you can’t really predict with certainty what will capture your attention and what won’t. You can’t simply will yourself to like things, either. As Jeff Bezos has observed, “One of the huge mistakes people make is that they try to force an interest on themselves.” Without experimenting, you can’t figure out which interests will stick, and which won’t. (Grit: The Power of Passion and Perserverance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duckworth’s emphasis on exploration serves as a powerful reminder that our passions are not predetermined or fixed. Rather, they emerge through a process of discovery and intentional exploration. We are invited to step outside our comfort zones and immerse ourselves in a world of possibilities, allowing curiosity to guide our journey. By venturing into unfamiliar territories, we open ourselves up to the serendipitous encounters and unexpected passions that can shape our career trajectory in extraordinary ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying out various interests and being open to new experiences aligns perfectly with the essence of generative AI. This cutting-edge technology leverages the power of machine learning to generate new ideas, concepts, and possibilities. It can assist individuals in exploring diverse career paths, unveiling uncharted territories, and uncovering hidden talents that may have remained dormant otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While preparing for the launch of the programs portal, I completed a scholarship application.  As part of the process, my application was screened by Azure Open AI and I was provided feedback and job recommendations.  I was surprised by some of the options that were suggested to me.  In fact, I’m consistently surprised by the depth and breadth of questions that ChatGPT will respond to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to deeply explore a the “systems analyst” job suggestions to get ideas of what the job entails and how I could potentially prepare for the interview.  I learned that I could prepare through online courses at Coursera and edX, that Accenture may be a company willing to hire a business major, and that I should explore a student membership with the Association for Information Systems.  Along the way, I also got information that would help me prepare for informational interviews like “can I be system analyst if I don’t know how to program?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that if I’m curious a short conversation can provide a lot of information that can make it easier to interact with the outside world.  At least it gives me a start.  I’m sharing to provide some inspiration of how others can use Generative AI to get more out of the feedback provided by the scholarship process.  You can see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.openai.com/share/7563a68b-e271-4d88-800f-bdd590b0a998&quot;&gt;full conversation&lt;/a&gt;; below I’m sharing the questions I asked and my motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does the career trajectory for system analyst look like over ten years?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I like understanding the end game.  Starting with the end mind helps me envision if this is a path I want to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do people normally stay in technology roles or are there opportunities to transition to other functions?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Even now, I’m an technology apologist - I’m much more interested in the business problems that technology can solve.  I ask question to try to get a deeper understanding of opportunity outside of IT.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What other roles do system analysts work with?  What other functions?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I didn’t like the first answer, four of the six options revolved around technology so I thought I would reframe to ask again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does a day to day of a System Analyst looks like?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the end state, I think it’s important to like your job.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the top companies that hire system analysts?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is an amazing question.  Getting this list really helps make discovery actionable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are ways that I can network with the above companies to get a job interview for a system analyst position?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I use this question to brainstorm on actions that I can take.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What professional associations and meetups for system analysts are available for college students to join?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising things for me when working Artificial Generative Intelligence is the depth that you can get ask answers.  If you want more details, ask.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking at the list of 20 companies above and these five associations can you create table that indicates the company name and the association that they are a member of?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m using the question to help prioritize my time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can college students get involved with the Association for Information Systems?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m using this question brainstorm appropriate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t have experience in an IT environment.  How can I get that experience as a college student or through AIS?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m using this question to brainstorm on ways I could meet job requirements when I graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are online courses and certifications that are available for system analyst roles that I should look at?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m looking at another way of meeting job requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are any of the above free or discounted for college students?  Are there YouTube videos that you can recommend?  Basically I’m looking for resources that can get me started.
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I’m looking for actions I can do now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking at the list of 20 companies above, what colleges do they recruit from?  What colleges also participate in the Association of Information Systems?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I think the insight you can get from this question is really interesting.  Accenture stood out from the list because they are willing ot interview talent from non-traditional degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What schools do the below hire from?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In a long conversation, Artificial Generative Intelligence will get lost.  Providing details can get the conversation back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the job requirements for a systems analyst at Accenture?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Getting very specific can lead to interesting insight.  This is the first time Technical Skills came up.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are there specific Coursera or edX courses that you can consider to learn about the software development life cycle?
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Likewise, being very specific can lead to actionable advice.  This helps prioritize time.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this exploration is useful, validation of interests only happens in the real world.  Generative AI is a compliment to traditional ways of preparing for a career - it helps surface blind spots and prioritize efforts.  It’s important to actively engage with the outside world, take risks, and pursue opportunities that resonate with you. By combining curiosity, exploration, and the insights gained from generative AI, you can embark on a transformative journey towards a fulfilling and meaningful career.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="career" /><summary type="html">Generative AI, like ChatGPT, can serve as a valuable tool in career exploration by providing insights and recommendations. It can help individuals uncover potential paths, discover resources such as online courses and professional associations, and prioritize efforts based on personalized feedback. However, while generative AI is beneficial, it should be complemented by real-world engagement, taking risks, and pursuing opportunities to validate and develop interests for a truly fulfilling career journey.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Sujeeth Foundation starts today</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/announcements/Unlock-the-Opportunity-of-Education/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Sujeeth Foundation starts today" /><published>2023-05-16T01:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-16T01:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/announcements/Unlock-the-Opportunity-of-Education</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/announcements/Unlock-the-Opportunity-of-Education/">&lt;p&gt;This week I filed the paperwork to start the Sujeeth Foundation.  I want to use the foundation to unlock the opportunity of education.  Education can train our youth to undertake professions that can enrich their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, education is broken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only 34% of workers in the US are engaged. This means that most people are not happy with their jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Student borrowers accumulated nearly $30,000 in undergraduate debt. This debt can be a burden for years after graduation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teaching youth growth mindset unlocks the potential for development.  Failure is part of success and embracing failure helps people take risks that lead to change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passion for what you do stems from learning what you do well and investing to develop your skills to solve a meaningful problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At their best, academic institutions are a place where experimentation thrives and opportunities to grow are abundant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The mindset of the student matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sujeeth Foundation provides scholarships to college students pursuing a STEM degree or graduate studies.  Scholarships are awarded based on Grit scores.  All applicants can take advantage of provided growth mindset training and other services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was raised in a family that believed in education.  I was told that if I studied hard, I would be recruited by employers and be ushered into a rewarding career.  The formula for success was simple - get good grades.  I ended up earning my B.A. in Economics from Saint Louis University in three frantic years.  During that time I also worked to support myself.  I didn’t sleep very much.  I also didn’t spend a significant amount of the time in the career center.  At the end of three years, I went to work at a call center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt that the promise was broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I realized that I missed the point.  People don’t hire you because of what you have done, they hire you because of what they think you can do.  I couldn’t say what I wanted to do.  I couldn’t explain how my skills were valuable.  I didn’t have a framework to launch a career from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I went back to school full time to earn my MBA from Washington University.  This time I was focused on entering consulting.  I had a clear picture that I needed to show that my accounting and analytic skills could contribute to a consulting team.  I eventually found a home at Microsoft that my valued my analytic skills, my technical propensity, and my sales experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a moment, the opportunity I received changed my stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This organization, this effort, is my attempt to pay forward the opportunity I was given.  I want to help people get jobs they love.  I think school is a great way to accomplish that if you keep the goal in focus.  That is why I filed the paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="announcements" /><summary type="html">This is the origin story of the Sujeeth Foundation.
