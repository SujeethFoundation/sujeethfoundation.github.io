<p>We get it. You’re busy. You’re tired. Maybe, deep down, you’re skeptical that all this “self-discovery” stuff actually matters. You came for a job, not therapy.</p>

<p>Fair enough. But here’s the reality most people learn too late:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If you don’t know yourself, the world will decide for you—and probably get it wrong.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-i-just-want-a-job-isnt-enough">Why “I Just Want a Job” Isn’t Enough</h3>

<p>Many students I mentor start with, “I just want a job—any job.” Understandable, but here’s the catch: that’s survival mode, not a strategy. Without specificity, mentors, hiring managers, and networks can’t truly help you. They don’t know how to connect you, advocate for you, or engage you in meaningful opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="you-dont-need-a-master-planyou-need-a-hypothesis">You Don’t Need a Master Plan—You Need a Hypothesis</h3>

<p>Identifying your ideal job isn’t about perfection. It’s about creating your best guess—a career hypothesis—and testing it in the real world. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What problems energize you?</li>
  <li>When do you feel most effective or fulfilled?</li>
  <li>Where do your natural strengths show up?</li>
</ul>

<p>These aren’t just abstract questions; they’re essential tools for finding jobs you genuinely enjoy.</p>

<h3 id="balancing-exploration-with-execution">Balancing Exploration with Execution</h3>

<p>Once you’ve formed a basic career hypothesis, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the next step: applying. Should you apply to everything? Only perfect matches? What if you’re still figuring things out?</p>

<p>That’s where a simple, consistent system helps. According to <em>TealHQ</em>, a platform for modern job seekers, your best bet is to apply to at least one job a day. But not randomly—strategically. Think of it like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with a <strong>base resume</strong> that includes all your experience.</li>
  <li>Tailor it for each application by highlighting only the most relevant parts.</li>
  <li>Keep your focus <strong>broad enough</strong> to explore, but <strong>specific enough</strong> to explain why you’re a fit.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s not about having it all figured out—it’s about making small, repeatable moves in a clear direction. You’ll learn faster, get feedback sooner, and increase your chances of finding a role that actually fits.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-youre-not-getting-interviews">What If You’re Not Getting Interviews?</h3>

<p>If you’re applying consistently and not hearing back, you’ve reached a critical decision point: <strong>pivot or persevere</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>pivot</strong> means refining or changing your hypothesis. This could mean exploring another interest that better matches current market needs or aligns more directly with your experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Persevering</strong> means doubling down—looking for ways to gain relevant experience to support your current target. That might involve volunteering, earning a certificate, enrolling in a specialized course, or finding stretch opportunities in your current environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both paths are valid. The key is to stay in motion and remain honest about what you’re learning along the way.</p>

<h3 id="personal-insight-why-i-walked-away-from-law">Personal Insight: Why I Walked Away from Law</h3>

<p>When I started college, I planned to become a lawyer—drawn to the idea of community impact and public service. But the deeper I dove, the clearer it became that my strengths were in strategy and technology, not meticulous detail or adversarial environments. Had I not reflected honestly, I might have ended up unhappy, deep in debt, and unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Instead, I found a role at Microsoft, a nexus of my true interests: finance, technology, and sales. This alignment not only energized me professionally but validated my initial hypothesis—transforming interests into lasting passions.</p>

<h3 id="clarity-creates-momentum">Clarity Creates Momentum</h3>

<p>Specificity, even if it’s tentative or messy, gives you a direction:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It makes your applications compelling.</li>
  <li>It helps you articulate clearly during interviews.</li>
  <li>It mobilizes mentors and allies effectively on your behalf.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specificity isn’t limiting; it’s liberating. It opens doors through intentional serendipity. And remember, targets are flexible—tools, not traps.</p>

<h3 id="youre-not-behindyoure-just-early">You’re Not Behind—You’re Just Early</h3>

<p>In a Career Circle, the goal isn’t immediate answers. It’s about fostering the space to ask better questions and discover meaningful insights. Exercises like the Coat of Arms, SMART goals, and career research aren’t mere busywork—they’re foundational tools that build your blueprint for success.</p>

<p>Because knowing yourself isn’t a luxury—it’s your greatest competitive advantage.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="bottom-line">Bottom Line:</h3>

<p>You already have everything you need to build a fulfilling career. But the world won’t hand it to you—you need to define it clearly.</p>

<p>So get curious. Ask the tough questions. Lean into reflection. You might be surprised by the doors it opens.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="career" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Feeling stuck in your job search?

<h3 id="why-this-might-actually-be-the-most-useful-thing-you-do-all-semester"><em>Why This Might Actually Be the Most Useful Thing You Do All Semester</em></h3>

<hr />

<p>Let’s be real.</p>

<p>You didn’t sign up for this.
Maybe a professor added you. Maybe someone said it “would look good.” Maybe you’re just here because you didn’t want to say no.</p>

<p>And right now, you might be wondering:
<strong>“What exactly <em>is</em> a Career Circle—and why should I care?”</strong></p>

<p>Here’s the short answer:
Career Circles aren’t about getting lectured.
They’re about getting <em>unstuck</em>.</p>

<p>Whether you know your dream job or feel completely lost, Career Circles give you a small group of real professionals and peers who are here to help you figure things out—without pressure, without judgment.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="if-youve-never-had-a-mentor-before-youre-not-alone"><strong>If You’ve Never Had a Mentor Before, You’re Not Alone</strong></h2>

<p>Most students haven’t.
Especially first-gen students. Especially students figuring out life while juggling school, work, or family.</p>

<p>You’ve probably had teachers, coaches, maybe even bosses—but a <strong>mentor</strong> is different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mentors guide. Sponsors promote. Coaches strategize.</strong> Career Circles focus on the first—helping you grow, not grading you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mentors don’t come in with a list of answers. They ask good questions. Share what they’ve learned. And help you explore what’s possible.</p>

<p>And here’s the thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Mentorship only works when you stop trying to impress and start getting real.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-even-is-a-career-circle"><strong>What Even <em>Is</em> a Career Circle?</strong></h2>

<p>It’s a six-week program.
One hour a week.
Small group. One trained mentor. You and a few students.</p>

<p>Each week, you’ll talk about stuff that rarely gets discussed in class:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do I actually care about?</li>
  <li>What kinds of jobs fit someone like me?</li>
  <li>How do I even get started if I don’t know anyone in my dream field?</li>
</ul>

<p>And you don’t have to figure any of it out alone.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research shows group mentoring (a.k.a. “mentoring circles”) boosts learning, builds peer accountability, and helps people feel less alone—especially when navigating career questions for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-this-might-matter-more-than-you-think"><strong>Why This Might Matter More Than You Think</strong></h2>

<p>You’ve probably heard “get a mentor” before.
But no one explains how to actually do that. Or what it means. Or why it’s worth it.</p>

<p>So here’s what mentoring research shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mentored students are <strong>more likely to be hired and promoted</strong></li>
  <li>They report <strong>higher confidence and job satisfaction</strong></li>
  <li>But over <strong>60% of mentorships fail</strong> due to unclear expectations and passive engagement</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The good news? You don’t need to be confident—you just need to be <em>curious</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-to-make-this-worth-your-time-even-if-youre-skeptical"><strong>How to Make This Worth Your Time (Even If You’re Skeptical)</strong></h2>

<p>Here are nine small shifts that turn Career Circles from “meh” to <em>meaningful</em>. You don’t need to do all 45 tips. Just pick a few. Try them out. See what happens.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-1-mindset--just-show-up-as-you-are"><strong>Stage 1: Mindset — Just Show Up As You Are</strong></h3>

<p>Before anything else, it starts with how you think. If you walk into mentorship expecting to be quizzed or judged, you’ll hold back. But if you treat it like a space to explore, ask questions, and grow—even awkwardly—you’ll start to see it differently. Most important growth doesn’t come from knowing more. It comes from seeing yourself differently.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mentoring works best when it creates a safe space—where you can be vulnerable, ask questions, and share doubts without fear of judgment.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>This might actually help—even if you don’t believe it yet</strong></li>
  <li><strong>You’re not behind—most people feel lost</strong></li>
  <li><strong>You’re allowed to not know</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asking questions &gt; faking confidence</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The goal isn’t perfection—it’s momentum</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-2-preparation--a-little-effort-goes-a-long-way"><strong>Stage 2: Preparation — A Little Effort Goes a Long Way</strong></h3>

<p>Mentorship isn’t a podcast. It’s a conversation. And conversations get way more valuable when you show up ready to say something real. Just five minutes of prep—reading your mentor’s bio, reflecting on your week, or drafting a question—can lead to breakthroughs you wouldn’t otherwise get.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mentees who “manage up”—by bringing questions, setting agendas, and sharing goals—experience faster growth and deeper mentor investment.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Look up your mentor—know who you’re talking to</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Bring one real question—anything you’re wondering about</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Write a “career hypothesis”—just a guess at what could fit you</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be honest about what you’re struggling with</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Say: “I’m figuring it out”—that’s enough</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-3-presence--you-dont-have-to-be-the-expert"><strong>Stage 3: Presence — You Don’t Have to Be the Expert</strong></h3>

<p>Being in the room matters more than being the smartest person in it. You don’t have to have all the answers. You just have to lean in. Turn your camera on. Speak up early. Pay attention. That energy you bring? It invites connection—and it gets returned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mentees who actively participate in mentoring sessions gain more trust, better feedback, and longer-term support.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Turn on your camera (even if you hate it)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be a few minutes early—it lowers anxiety</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Say something in the first 10 minutes—it gets easier</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Listen like someone might say something that changes your mind</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Support your group—it helps everyone feel safe</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-4-action--try-one-small-thing"><strong>Stage 4: Action — Try One Small Thing</strong></h3>

<p>Thinking is great. Doing is better. Every small action—editing your LinkedIn, writing a cold message, trying something your mentor suggests—builds confidence. And it signals to your mentor (and yourself) that you’re taking this seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Acting on mentor feedback—even in tiny ways—builds momentum and deepens trust.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Try one tip your mentor gives you</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fix one line on your LinkedIn or resume</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Send a follow-up message to someone you met</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Say “I tried this and it helped” next week</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Celebrate even small wins—it builds motivation</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-5-application--practice--perfect-plans"><strong>Stage 5: Application — Practice &gt; Perfect Plans</strong></h3>

<p>You don’t get better by thinking your way into success. You get better by practicing. Career Circles give you a safe space to test ideas, try pitches, and mess up before it matters. That practice? It’s your power-up.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Practice your elevator pitch (even if it feels awkward)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Search job titles you’ve never heard of</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Send one message to someone doing something cool</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Mock interview with a peer</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Write your “About Me”—ask for feedback</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-6-identity--your-career-should-fit-you"><strong>Stage 6: Identity — Your Career Should Fit <em>You</em></strong></h3>

<p>You’re not a clone. You’re not a checkbox. You’re a full person with values, fears, dreams, and superpowers. Mentorship helps you surface those—and align your next step with who you are, not just what’s available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mentees who reflect on values, strengths, and fears make smarter, more confident career decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>List what you’re good at—and what you enjoy</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Write down one value you want in your future job</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be honest about what scares you</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Tell your story—how’d you get here?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Ask: “Does this feel like a good fit?”</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-7-community--youre-not-alone-in-this"><strong>Stage 7: Community — You’re Not Alone in This</strong></h3>

<p>It’s easy to feel like you’re the only one who doesn’t have it figured out. But Career Circles prove otherwise. The peers around you? They’re navigating the same questions. When you support each other, everyone grows faster.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mentoring circles help students feel less isolated, especially when they share challenges and encourage each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Shout someone out—build good energy</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Drop a resource—”this helped me…”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Start a group chat for support</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Keep in touch—even after the program ends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Just be kind—it builds trust</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-8-momentum--the-real-growth-happens-after"><strong>Stage 8: Momentum — The Real Growth Happens After</strong></h3>

<p>Mentorship isn’t magic. It’s a launchpad. What matters most is what you do next. After the final session, keep the thread going. Reconnect. Follow through. Reflect. That’s where the long-term wins show up.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Save your notes</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Reach back out in 2 months</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Ask for a referral <em>after</em> you’ve built trust</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Keep the group alive—it’s your new network</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Write a short reflection—capture what shifted</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="stage-9-ownership--you-dont-need-permission"><strong>Stage 9: Ownership — You Don’t Need Permission</strong></h3>

<p>No one is coming to rescue your career. But you’re not on your own either. Mentors are here to walk with you. But you steer. You choose. You build.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mentorship is most effective when mentees drive the relationship—setting goals, applying feedback, and following through.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Take feedback seriously—not personally</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Tweak your plan as you go</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Experiment—it’s how you learn what works</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Be real, not perfect</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Leave with a plan—not just a good memory</strong></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="still-not-sure-thats-okay"><strong>Still Not Sure? That’s Okay</strong></h2>

<p>You don’t have to be certain. You don’t have to be passionate. You just have to be open.</p>

<p>Career Circles aren’t here to fix you.
They’re here to remind you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You have more options than you think.</strong>
And more support than you realize.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give it a shot. Show up once. Ask one question.
That’s how momentum starts.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="career" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Feeling skeptical about mentorship?

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>College is more than just picking a major or landing an internship—it’s a time to ask big questions. One of the biggest: <em>“What’s my purpose?”</em></p>

<p>Knowing your purpose isn’t about having your whole life mapped out. It’s about getting clearer on what drives you—what matters to you—and using that insight to make better choices, build meaningful relationships, and open the right doors. In this post, we’ll show you how to begin discovering your purpose by reflecting on your past and connecting it to where you are today and where you want to go.</p>

<p>One of the best tools to help? An exercise called <strong>“Build Your Coat of Arms.”</strong> It’s simple, but powerful. Let’s dive in.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="understanding-purpose">Understanding Purpose</h3>

<p>Your purpose is the thread that connects what you care about, what you’re good at, and what impact you want to make. It’s what gets you up in the morning—or would, if you had more clarity.</p>

<p>But purpose doesn’t just show up one day. You find it through reflection: by looking at your experiences, recognizing your strengths, and naming the values that guide your decisions. That’s how you start to see patterns—and possibilities.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="connecting-purpose-to-your-past">Connecting Purpose to Your Past</h3>

<p>Your past holds clues about your future. Here’s how to mine those insights:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Spot the Key Moments</strong>: Think back over the past 10 years. What experiences shaped you? What moments were joyful, painful, surprising, or proud?</li>
  <li><strong>Look for Themes</strong>: Are there common threads—subjects that always excite you, causes you care about, skills you keep using? Successes and failures can both reveal where your energy naturally flows.</li>
  <li><strong>Name Your Values</strong>: What mattered most to you in those moments? Integrity? Creativity? Helping others? Achievement? These values often point directly to your purpose.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="try-this-build-your-coat-of-arms">Try This: Build Your Coat of Arms</h3>

<p>This reflection exercise helps you look at your life through a meaningful lens—your story, your now, and your next.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>10 Years Ago</strong>: Where were you? What shaped your identity? How did you see the world then, and how have you grown?</li>
  <li><strong>Today</strong>: What strengths and values define you now? What do people rely on you for? What energizes or drains you?</li>
  <li><strong>5 Years from Now</strong>: What kind of life do you want to be living? What kind of work feels meaningful? What steps could move you in that direction?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>This simple exercise can clarify more than you expect. When you start sharing your story from this perspective, people listen—and often want to help.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="principle-self-awareness-leads-to-clarity">Principle: Self-Awareness Leads to Clarity</h3>

<p>You don’t need to have it all figured out. But the more self-aware you are, the easier it is to make confident decisions, attract support, and pursue opportunities that fit <em>you</em>—not someone else’s idea of success.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="reminder-purpose-is-iterative">Reminder: Purpose is Iterative</h3>

<p>You’re not locking in your entire future here. Purpose evolves. It deepens as you grow, stumble, and try new things. That’s a good thing. It means you don’t have to be perfect—you just have to keep learning.</p>

<p>These two ideas can help you keep going:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Growth Mindset</strong>: Believe you can grow your abilities through effort and feedback. Challenges aren’t roadblocks—they’re stepping stones.</li>
  <li><strong>Grit</strong>: Stick with your goals, even when it’s hard. Grit isn’t about never failing—it’s about not giving up when you do.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="why-it-matters-now">Why It Matters Now</h3>

<p>Clarity about your purpose doesn’t just help you feel better—it helps you <strong>take action</strong>. It makes your job search more focused. Your LinkedIn profile more compelling. Your conversations more memorable.</p>

<p>And perhaps most importantly: when <strong>you</strong> understand what you’re about, it becomes easier for <strong>others</strong> to support you, mentor you, and open doors.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Finding your purpose isn’t a one-time event—it’s a practice. The more you reflect on your story, the clearer your direction becomes.</p>

<p>Start with the “Build Your Coat of Arms” exercise. Give yourself the gift of reflection. Then, start sharing what you’re learning—with mentors, friends, and your community. Because purpose isn’t just something you find. It’s something you build, over time, with courage and curiosity.</p>

We share stories to inspire and educate.  We hope students can leverage this experience in their own journey.</p>

<p>For college juniors preparing to launch their careers, the path ahead can feel both exciting and uncertain. How do you land that first job? What skills truly matter? How do you turn a job into a fulfilling career? To help answer these questions, we spoke with Dave D’Abate, a successful Account Executive whose career journey is proof that relationships, continuous learning, and adaptability are key ingredients for long-term success.</p>

<h2 id="starting-strong-lessons-from-the-first-job">Starting Strong: Lessons from the First Job</h2>
<p>Dave’s career began at AT&amp;T as a retail sales consultant. Like many fresh graduates, he started in an entry-level role, selling devices and services to both consumers and small business accounts. But what set him apart? His mindset. While others simply met expectations, Dave aimed higher—doubling his sales targets and positioning himself as a go-to resource and subject matter expert.</p>

<p>He quickly learned that success isn’t just about showing up; it’s about being proactive. “I had to put in the effort beyond what I witnessed from my colleagues,” he says. This willingness to go the extra mile became a defining trait in his career.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b>
    Lesson - Starting Strong: Success in a first job requires a proactive mindset and a willingness to exceed expectations. Dave excelled by doubling his sales targets and establishing himself as a subject matter expert.
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="breaking-into-the-workforce-the-power-of-first-impressions">Breaking into the Workforce: The Power of First Impressions</h2>
<p>Landing that first job can be daunting, but Dave emphasizes the importance of energy, enthusiasm, and preparation. One piece of advice he received early on has stuck with him: “Every conversation you have is an interview.” From the very first screening call to the final handshake, the way you present yourself matters. Being able to articulate your work ethic and passion can make all the difference in standing out to hiring managers.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-career-key-lessons-and-mindset-shifts">Building a Career: Key Lessons and Mindset Shifts</h2>
<p>Over the years, Dave has picked up several insights that have fueled his success:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Be willing to learn.</strong> Taking the extra time to do something correctly now will set you up for success later.</li>
  <li><strong>Manage your business.</strong> If something needs to get done, schedule time for it—otherwise, it won’t happen.</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptability is key.</strong> You won’t always succeed on the first try, but the ability to adjust and improve will make you stronger.</li>
  <li><strong>Incorporate feedback immediately.</strong> When someone offers guidance, show them that their investment in you is worth it by implementing changes right away.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b>
    Lesson - Investing in Success: Actively seek mentors, apply their knowledge, and maintain a commitment to lifelong learning. If you’re the smartest in the room, challenge yourself to grow by seeking new opportunities.
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="from-college-to-career-the-importance-of-preparation">From College to Career: The Importance of Preparation</h2>
<p>Dave admits that he wasn’t the best student in college—he spent more time hiking than studying. But he quickly realized that preparation is everything. “Studying in college is very similar to how one should prepare before any meeting,” he explains. Whether it’s a class or a client presentation, showing up unprepared is never an option. Observing how others operate and borrowing their best practices can help you refine your own approach over time.</p>

<h2 id="final-advice-for-students-entering-the-workforce">Final Advice for Students Entering the Workforce</h2>
<p>Dave’s parting wisdom for students is simple yet powerful: “Always set aside time to continue investing in your success.” Seek out mentors who are invested in your growth, absorb their knowledge, and apply it. But never stop learning—if you ever find yourself as the smartest person in the room, it’s time to find a different room.</p>

<p>As you chart your own career path, remember that success isn’t a straight line. It’s built on hard work, adaptability, and the relationships you nurture along the way. Take a page from Dave D’Abate’s journey, and embrace every opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

We share stories to inspire and educate.  We hope students can leverage this experience in their own journey.</p>

<p>Planning your career might seem daunting, but learning from those who have navigated similar paths can be both inspiring and insightful. One such story is that of Laurel Dzneladze, a dynamic professional at Microsoft whose journey showcases the power of adaptability, networking, and continuous learning.</p>

<h2 id="finding-passion-through-experience">Finding Passion Through Experience</h2>
<p>Laurel currently supports the Microsoft Viva Community and communication products, focusing on product marketing and go-to-market strategies. Her passion lies in how community and communications shape an organization’s success. Throughout her career, she has dedicated herself to building solutions that drive engagement, productivity, and overall success within companies.</p>

<p>Her career trajectory wasn’t a straight line, but each experience helped shape her professional path. Laurel’s story is proof that discovering your Ikigai—the intersection of passion, mission, vocation, and profession—takes time, experimentation, and a willingness to explore different opportunities.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b>
    Lesson - Adaptability and Nonlinear Paths: Laurel’s career path and academic journey were unconventional, showing that flexibility and persistence can lead to success. Careers don’t have to follow a straight line, and varied experiences can become valuable assets.
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="from-internship-to-full-time-success">From Internship to Full-Time Success</h2>
<p>Laurel’s first job came as an extension of an internship at Johnson Controls, which transitioned into a full-time role after graduation. In this position, she was responsible for communicating large organizational changes and managing digital spaces like the company’s website and intranet.
Some of her most valuable lessons from this early experience included:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Understanding organizational processes</strong>—how to start and complete a project effectively.</li>
  <li><strong>Developing presentation and executive relationship skills</strong>—key abilities that help in gaining visibility and trust.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborating in a corporate environment</strong>—learning how to navigate teams and work cross-functionally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="landing-the-first-job-a-lesson-in-proactive-networking">Landing the First Job: A Lesson in Proactive Networking</h2>
<p>How did Laurel secure her internship that led to her first job? It started with an unpaid marketing role at a performing arts foundation, where she dedicated just four hours a week. That experience gave her exposure to a network of professionals, including board members who later connected her with the internship opportunity at Johnson Controls.
Her journey highlights a crucial strategy:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Start small, be proactive, and leverage networking opportunities. Even the smallest roles can lead to significant career breakthroughs when approached with the right mindset.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="career-lessons-and-mindset-shifts">Career Lessons and Mindset Shifts</h2>
<p>Throughout her career, Laurel has embraced a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability. Here are some of her key insights:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Share ideas early and often</strong>—don’t be afraid to put your thoughts out there.</li>
  <li><strong>Ask questions instead of disagreeing outright</strong>—a great approach to constructive discussions.</li>
  <li><strong>Observe and learn from leadership</strong>—find role models whose work ethic and leadership style resonate with you.</li>
  <li><strong>Look beyond your immediate team</strong>—seek projects outside your role that expose you to new challenges and learning opportunities.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="embracing-a-nonlinear-path">Embracing a Nonlinear Path</h2>
<p>Laurel’s college experience was anything but conventional. She started as a dance major in Kansas City, studied abroad for a year, then took time off before resuming college at 25 years old. She compressed 2.5 years of coursework into just 1.5 years, proving that determination and flexibility can reshape one’s academic and career path.</p>

<p>This unconventional journey reinforced an important lesson: careers are not always linear. The skills and experiences you gain from varied paths can become assets in unexpected ways.</p>
