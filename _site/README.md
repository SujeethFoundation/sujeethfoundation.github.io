> Together we can make a lasting impact on a student's life and help them achieve their dreams.

At the Sujeeth Foundation, we help students network into their first job. Nearly half of college graduates struggle with job placement. The Sujeeth Foundation strives to help students practice agency through Career Circles.  We partner students with a mentor for a six-week program that encourages students to exercise agency in their career.  

College is a place where experimentation thrives and opportunities to grow are abundant. We help students unlock the opportunity of education.

Together we make a lasting impact. 

## Our Sauce 
We partner students with a mentor for a six-week program that encourages students to exercise agency in their career.

### Building a Brighter Future
The magic of the program happens in the weekly career circle calls.  Ideally, students are leading and facilitating these circles themselves.  In practice, volunteers are often guiding early sessions encouraging students to engage deeper so that they get to the purpose of the week. 

We believe in promoting a mindset of resilience, a determined work ethic, and the transparent sharing of knowledge. Empowering students with these principles, we help them network into their first job.

### What do we do? — Help students to transform their lives and find their career path
To help students translate interest into a career, we pair students with a mentor.  We encourage students to shape their job search to reflect their own interests as well as market signal.  Through a program of eight meetings we try to shape student perspectives across their job search. 

The Career Circle program is structured according to the applicant journey: Self-Assessment, Research and Exploration, Resume and Preparation, Networking, Job Applications, Interviews, Follow-up, and Negotiations.  The focus for each meeting is small group discussions.  Short videos and exercises help set context.  Options are provided to dive deeper through with additional resources. 

### Why are we doing this? — Higher education can be expensive, but the benefits are worth it
We strongly believe that investing in students means investing in a better world. Through scholarships, training, and various services, we support college students. By helping students pursue their educational dreams, we're creating a brighter future—for both them and our communities. Together, we strive to build a fair and equal society where everyone can reach their fullest potential.

## What Students Are Saying
"While our meetings at 1 p.m. on Mondays made my schedule a bit busier, they always left me feeling empowered because each lesson was meaningful. The skills and insights I gained prepared me for my professional life and gave me valuable tips for succeeding in interviews."

"My mentor shared valuable advice that is relevant for preparing my group and I for a future career, life after college, and how to navigate this last year of undergrad. The steps that my mentor took during our meetings includes relating each week's topic to real world topics and previous meetings, connecting with each other on LinkedIn, and so on. These meetings resulted in a new professional connection and advice that I will remember throughout life." 

"One positive realization I came to at the end of our meeting is that if you never try, you will never know. It is better to try something new in a career or in life than regret it later on. This experience has been so rewarding and I gained many new friends as well as a wonderful mentor through this experience."
