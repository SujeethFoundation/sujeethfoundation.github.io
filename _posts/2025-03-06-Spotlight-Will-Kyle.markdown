Navigating a career path can be daunting for college juniors looking ahead to life after graduation.

But stories of success can inspire and guide us—and Will Kyle’s journey from an entry-level sales job to leading a team at Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of perseverance, adaptability, and growth.

#Starting Out: The First Job That Built a Foundation
Will Kyle’s first job out of college was far from glamorous—selling steel buildings. It wasn’t his dream job, nor was it in an industry he was particularly passionate about, but it was an opportunity to gain experience, develop his skills, and prove himself in the professional world.

At the time, the economy was in a recession, making job opportunities scarce. Will applied to any and every sales role he could find. After spotting an ad online for a steel building company, he took the leap. His role involved managing a network of steel building dealers, prospecting new customers, and running advertising campaigns. The company was resistant to technology, forcing him to work without the efficiencies of modern tools. Yet, instead of seeing this as a setback, he saw it as a learning experience.

With no structured training in sales, Will took ownership of his own professional development. He read books, sought mentorship, and pushed himself out of his comfort zone. The key lesson? Success is rarely handed to you—it’s something you must actively pursue.

Today, as an Enterprise Sales Leader at AWS, Will is responsible for business planning, consultative selling, and leading high-impact initiatives. Over the past four years at AWS, he has excelled in multiple roles, including Senior Account Executive, where he leveraged his deep expertise in sales presentations and strategic client engagement.

His career at AWS has given him the opportunity to lead a team of professionals, drive enterprise growth, and work at the cutting edge of cloud technology. Most importantly, he has continued to develop his passion for mentorship—helping individuals advance their careers both within and outside of Amazon.

# Lessons from the Journey: Building a Network and Asking for Help
Reflecting on his career, Will emphasizes the importance of networking and mentorship. “Every single person you meet is an opportunity to expand your network. Never burn a bridge,” he advises. Throughout his career, he has found that there are always people willing to help—but it’s up to you to ask for guidance. Taking initiative in building relationships and seeking mentorship can be game-changing.

# Advice for College Juniors: The First Job is Just a Stepping Stone

Your first job out of school doesn’t have to be your dream job. It’s a stepping stone—a chance to learn, build skills, and prove yourself to future employers. Instead of limiting yourself to roles that seem perfect, embrace opportunities that allow you to grow. Your passions and goals will evolve over time, and the most important thing is to keep moving forward.
