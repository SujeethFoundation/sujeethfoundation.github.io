The **Career Circle Program** is a 6-week mentorship program designed to help college juniors navigate the job search process. Each week focuses on a specific aspect of career development, offering students the tools and strategies they need to succeed in landing their first job. Mentors provide guidance, share personal experiences, and help students grow both personally and professionally. Here’s an overview of the program week by week:

### [Week 1: Self-Assessment Presentation](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/kepypoEuftS0WnYy)

**Objective**: Understand your strengths, goals, and areas of growth to make better career decisions.

**Agenda**:
- **Introductions and Icebreaker**: Get to know your peers and mentors.
- **Brené Brown Interview Clip**: Discuss vulnerability and building trust in professional settings.
- **Exercise - Build Your Coat of Arms**: Reflect on your personal and professional journey.
- **Group Discussion**: Focus on vulnerability, personal stories, and trust-building.

In Week 1, the goal is to build trust within the group and encourage students to share their experiences. The content focuses on helping students craft a personal narrative that connects their goals with their past, addressing the common challenge of poorly differentiated resumes due to a lack of work history. To foster an emotionally safe environment for open sharing, the concept of vulnerability, based on Brené Brown’s work, is introduced. This allows students to feel comfortable expressing themselves authentically. Facilitators should model vulnerability, encourage reflection, create a non-judgmental space for sharing, and follow up to reinforce the power of vulnerability in professional growth.

### [Week 2: Research & Exploration Presentation](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/PzxsrWjSmfNb90nx)

**Objective**: Learn how to explore industries, roles, and companies that align with your goals.

**Agenda**:
- **Group Reflection**: Discuss strategies for exploring job opportunities.
- **Video: Identifying Your Career Path**: Understanding your values and aligning them with career choices.
- **Exercise**: Research companies and roles to identify your fit.
- **Group Discussion**: Share insights and challenges in the exploration process.

In Week 2, the goal is to help students understand that their target job should align with their individual interests, creating a unique fit they can explain in conversations and later use in crafting their resume. The concept of Ikigai is introduced, which helps define personal purpose by exploring the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what you can be paid for, and what the world needs. This allows students to reflect on their passions and skills to better target career opportunities. To further support this, a ChatGPT exercise is incorporated to encourage exploration. Additionally, networking is introduced through a LinkedIn Learning video focused on connecting with hiring managers. This prepares students to identify and engage with key individuals who can help them access job opportunities, once they have clarity on their target role.

### [Week 3: Resume & Preparation Presentation](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/DRldmn7xluDQAvW9)

**Objective**: Develop a strong base resume and optimize your LinkedIn profile for job applications.

**Agenda**:

- **Exercise: Create or Update LinkedIn Profile**: Align your online presence with your resume.

In Week 3, the goal is to guide students in personalizing their resumes to better match their target positions. To demonstrate the power of personalization, we introduce Simon Sinek’s interview, The Origin of Why, emphasizing that employers hire based on what they believe a candidate can contribute. Personalizing a resume helps clarify why a candidate is the right fit, making it more likely that a hiring manager will recognize the candidate's potential. We also introduce the concept of a Base Resume, a tool that makes creating personalized resumes easier by keeping a comprehensive record of all experiences. This approach allows students to quickly tailor their resume to specific job roles instead of starting from scratch every time. The week concludes with a review of the basics for customizing LinkedIn profiles, ensuring that students understand how to present themselves effectively online.

In Week 4, the goal is to encourage students to start networking actively. We introduce John Stepper's concept of Work Out Loud as a powerful foundation for building professional relationships. By sharing their work and progress openly, students can attract opportunities and connections that align with their goals. To facilitate this, we include a ChatGPT exercise designed to identify potential thought leaders and professionals who can help students network into target companies. The week wraps up with a review of social media best practices, equipping students with the knowledge they need to manage their online presence effectively for professional networking.

**Objective**: Refine your job search strategy and improve interview storytelling techniques.

In Week 5, the focus shifts to best practices for job applications and interviews. Students are encouraged to reflect on whether they should personalize each job application or take a mass application approach, a concept explored in the "How Many Jobs" podcast. The session also includes practice with the Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR) framework, helping students craft compelling stories to communicate their experiences and outcomes effectively during interviews. Additionally, the Lean Startup approach is introduced, encouraging students to view each job application and interview as an experiment. This mindset promotes learning from each experience, improving their strategies over time and enhancing their chances of success in future job opportunities.

### [Week 6: Follow-up & Negotiation Presentation](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/fDfKmMJai2dnuwDb)

Rather than treating networking and follow-ups as transactional, students are encouraged to prioritize meaningful connections. The session introduces The Power of Regret by Daniel Pink, which explores four types of regret—foundation, boldness, moral, and connection—and how they shape decision-making. By reflecting on relationship regrets, students can make more intentional choices in their professional interactions. While job searches often aim to avoid mistakes, setbacks and regrets can serve as valuable learning opportunities, guiding students toward better decisions and stronger professional relationships.

Our goal is to help students network into their first job.  By catching them where they are, we can coach them on subjects that matter to their individual journey.

The best mentors:
1️⃣Facilitate discussion instead of presenting content
2️⃣Respond to requests instead of staying locked in the agenda
3️⃣Explain the principle instead of focusing on specifics

The Career Circle Program offers a comprehensive framework for students to develop the skills and mindset necessary for success in their job search. Throughout each week, students will gain hands-on experience and valuable insights to help them navigate the complexities of entering the workforce.
