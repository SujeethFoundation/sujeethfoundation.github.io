excerpt: "Generative AI, like ChatGPT, can serve as a valuable tool in career exploration by providing insights and recommendations. It can help individuals uncover potential paths, discover resources such as online courses and professional associations, and prioritize efforts based on personalized feedback. However, while generative AI is beneficial, it should be complemented by real-world engagement, taking risks, and pursuing opportunities to validate and develop interests for a truly fulfilling career journey."

In the pursuit of a fulfilling career, Angela Duckworth's wisdom on early exploration and cultivating passion resonates deeply. She reminds us that the path to finding our true calling requires more than just picking a job; it demands an open mind, an adventurous spirit, and a willingness to embrace unexpected opportunities. By exploring different career paths, understanding that passion can be developed, and aligning with our core values, we set the stage for a transformative journey. 

What are your interests?

> interests are not discovered through introspection. Instead, interests are triggered by interactions with the outside world. The process of interest discovery can be messy, serendipitous, and inefficient. This is because you can’t really predict with certainty what will capture your attention and what won’t. You can’t simply will yourself to like things, either. As Jeff Bezos has observed, “One of the huge mistakes people make is that they try to force an interest on themselves.” Without experimenting, you can’t figure out which interests will stick, and which won’t. (Grit: The Power of Passion and Perserverance)

Duckworth's emphasis on exploration serves as a powerful reminder that our passions are not predetermined or fixed. Rather, they emerge through a process of discovery and intentional exploration. We are invited to step outside our comfort zones and immerse ourselves in a world of possibilities, allowing curiosity to guide our journey. By venturing into unfamiliar territories, we open ourselves up to the serendipitous encounters and unexpected passions that can shape our career trajectory in extraordinary ways.

Trying out various interests and being open to new experiences aligns perfectly with the essence of generative AI. This cutting-edge technology leverages the power of machine learning to generate new ideas, concepts, and possibilities. It can assist individuals in exploring diverse career paths, unveiling uncharted territories, and uncovering hidden talents that may have remained dormant otherwise.

While preparing for the launch of the programs portal, I completed a scholarship application.  As part of the process, my application was screened by Azure Open AI and I was provided feedback and job recommendations.  I was surprised by some of the options that were suggested to me.  In fact, I'm consistently surprised by the depth and breadth of questions that ChatGPT will respond to.

I decided to deeply explore a the "systems analyst" job suggestions to get ideas of what the job entails and how I could potentially prepare for the interview.  I learned that I could prepare through online courses at Coursera and edX, that Accenture may be a company willing to hire a business major, and that I should explore a student membership with the Association for Information Systems.  Along the way, I also got information that would help me prepare for informational interviews like "can I be system analyst if I don't know how to program?".  

It strikes me that if I'm curious a short conversation can provide a lot of information that can make it easier to interact with the outside world.  At least it gives me a start.  I'm sharing to provide some inspiration of how others can use Generative AI to get more out of the feedback provided by the scholarship process.  You can see the [full conversation](https://chat.openai.com/share/7563a68b-e271-4d88-800f-bdd590b0a998); below I'm sharing the questions I asked and my motivation.
