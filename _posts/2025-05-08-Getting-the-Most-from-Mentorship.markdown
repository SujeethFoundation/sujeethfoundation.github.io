## **This Isn’t School—It’s Mentorship**

### *Why This Might Actually Be the Most Useful Thing You Do All Semester*

---

Let’s be real.

You didn’t sign up for this.
Maybe a professor added you. Maybe someone said it “would look good.” Maybe you’re just here because you didn’t want to say no.

And right now, you might be wondering:
**“What exactly *is* a Career Circle—and why should I care?”**

Here’s the short answer:
Career Circles aren’t about getting lectured.
They’re about getting *unstuck*.

Whether you know your dream job or feel completely lost, Career Circles give you a small group of real professionals and peers who are here to help you figure things out—without pressure, without judgment.

## **If You’ve Never Had a Mentor Before, You’re Not Alone**

Most students haven’t.
Especially first-gen students. Especially students figuring out life while juggling school, work, or family.

You’ve probably had teachers, coaches, maybe even bosses—but a **mentor** is different.

> **Mentors guide. Sponsors promote. Coaches strategize.** Career Circles focus on the first—helping you grow, not grading you. 

Mentors don’t come in with a list of answers. They ask good questions. Share what they’ve learned. And help you explore what’s possible.

And here’s the thing:

> **Mentorship only works when you stop trying to impress and start getting real.**

---

## **What Even *Is* a Career Circle?**

It’s a six-week program.
One hour a week.
Small group. One trained mentor. You and a few students.

Each week, you’ll talk about stuff that rarely gets discussed in class:

* What do I actually care about?
* What kinds of jobs fit someone like me?
* How do I even get started if I don’t know anyone in my dream field?

And you don’t have to figure any of it out alone.

> Research shows group mentoring (a.k.a. "mentoring circles") boosts learning, builds peer accountability, and helps people feel less alone—especially when navigating career questions for the first time.

## **Why This Might Matter More Than You Think**

You’ve probably heard “get a mentor” before.
But no one explains how to actually do that. Or what it means. Or why it’s worth it.

So here’s what mentoring research shows:

* Mentored students are **more likely to be hired and promoted**
* They report **higher confidence and job satisfaction**
* But over **60% of mentorships fail** due to unclear expectations and passive engagement 

> The good news? You don’t need to be confident—you just need to be *curious*.

## **How to Make This Worth Your Time (Even If You’re Skeptical)**

Here are nine small shifts that turn Career Circles from "meh" to *meaningful*. You don’t need to do all 45 tips. Just pick a few. Try them out. See what happens.

---

### **Stage 1: Mindset — Just Show Up As You Are**

Before anything else, it starts with how you think. If you walk into mentorship expecting to be quizzed or judged, you’ll hold back. But if you treat it like a space to explore, ask questions, and grow—even awkwardly—you’ll start to see it differently. Most important growth doesn’t come from knowing more. It comes from seeing yourself differently.

> Mentoring works best when it creates a safe space—where you can be vulnerable, ask questions, and share doubts without fear of judgment. 

1. **This might actually help—even if you don’t believe it yet**
2. **You’re not behind—most people feel lost**
3. **You’re allowed to not know**
4. **Asking questions > faking confidence**
5. **The goal isn’t perfection—it’s momentum**

---

### **Stage 2: Preparation — A Little Effort Goes a Long Way**

Mentorship isn’t a podcast. It’s a conversation. And conversations get way more valuable when you show up ready to say something real. Just five minutes of prep—reading your mentor’s bio, reflecting on your week, or drafting a question—can lead to breakthroughs you wouldn’t otherwise get.

> Mentees who "manage up"—by bringing questions, setting agendas, and sharing goals—experience faster growth and deeper mentor investment. 

6. **Look up your mentor—know who you’re talking to**
7. **Bring one real question—anything you’re wondering about**
8. **Write a "career hypothesis"—just a guess at what could fit you**
9. **Be honest about what you’re struggling with**
10. **Say: "I’m figuring it out"—that’s enough**

---

### **Stage 3: Presence — You Don’t Have to Be the Expert**

Being in the room matters more than being the smartest person in it. You don’t have to have all the answers. You just have to lean in. Turn your camera on. Speak up early. Pay attention. That energy you bring? It invites connection—and it gets returned.

> Mentees who actively participate in mentoring sessions gain more trust, better feedback, and longer-term support. 

11. **Turn on your camera (even if you hate it)**
12. **Be a few minutes early—it lowers anxiety**
13. **Say something in the first 10 minutes—it gets easier**
14. **Listen like someone might say something that changes your mind**
15. **Support your group—it helps everyone feel safe**

---

### **Stage 4: Action — Try One Small Thing**

Thinking is great. Doing is better. Every small action—editing your LinkedIn, writing a cold message, trying something your mentor suggests—builds confidence. And it signals to your mentor (and yourself) that you’re taking this seriously.

> Acting on mentor feedback—even in tiny ways—builds momentum and deepens trust. 

21. **Try one tip your mentor gives you**
22. **Fix one line on your LinkedIn or resume**
23. **Send a follow-up message to someone you met**
24. **Say "I tried this and it helped" next week**
25. **Celebrate even small wins—it builds motivation**

---

### **Stage 5: Application — Practice > Perfect Plans**

You don’t get better by thinking your way into success. You get better by practicing. Career Circles give you a safe space to test ideas, try pitches, and mess up before it matters. That practice? It’s your power-up.

26. **Practice your elevator pitch (even if it feels awkward)**
27. **Search job titles you’ve never heard of**
28. **Send one message to someone doing something cool**
29. **Mock interview with a peer**
30. **Write your “About Me”—ask for feedback**

---

### **Stage 6: Identity — Your Career Should Fit *You***

You’re not a clone. You’re not a checkbox. You’re a full person with values, fears, dreams, and superpowers. Mentorship helps you surface those—and align your next step with who you are, not just what’s available.

> Mentees who reflect on values, strengths, and fears make smarter, more confident career decisions. 

31. **List what you’re good at—and what you enjoy**
32. **Write down one value you want in your future job**
33. **Be honest about what scares you**
34. **Tell your story—how’d you get here?**
35. **Ask: "Does this feel like a good fit?"**

---

### **Stage 7: Community — You’re Not Alone in This**

It’s easy to feel like you’re the only one who doesn’t have it figured out. But Career Circles prove otherwise. The peers around you? They’re navigating the same questions. When you support each other, everyone grows faster.

> Mentoring circles help students feel less isolated, especially when they share challenges and encourage each other. 

36. **Shout someone out—build good energy**
37. **Drop a resource—"this helped me…"**
38. **Start a group chat for support**
39. **Keep in touch—even after the program ends**
40. **Just be kind—it builds trust**

---

### **Stage 8: Momentum — The Real Growth Happens After**

Mentorship isn’t magic. It’s a launchpad. What matters most is what you do next. After the final session, keep the thread going. Reconnect. Follow through. Reflect. That’s where the long-term wins show up.

41. **Save your notes**
42. **Reach back out in 2 months**
43. **Ask for a referral *after* you’ve built trust**
44. **Keep the group alive—it’s your new network**
45. **Write a short reflection—capture what shifted**

---

### **Stage 9: Ownership — You Don’t Need Permission**

No one is coming to rescue your career. But you’re not on your own either. Mentors are here to walk with you. But you steer. You choose. You build.

> Mentorship is most effective when mentees drive the relationship—setting goals, applying feedback, and following through. 

46. **Take feedback seriously—not personally**
47. **Tweak your plan as you go**
48. **Experiment—it’s how you learn what works**
49. **Be real, not perfect**
50. **Leave with a plan—not just a good memory**

---

## **Still Not Sure? That’s Okay**

You don’t have to be certain. You don’t have to be passionate. You just have to be open.

Career Circles aren’t here to fix you.
They’re here to remind you:

> **You have more options than you think.**
> And more support than you realize.

Give it a shot. Show up once. Ask one question.
That’s how momentum starts.
