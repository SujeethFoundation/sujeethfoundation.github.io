For many college juniors, the uncertainty of what comes next can be overwhelming. You might be wondering if your major is the right fit, how to land your first job, or whether the twists and turns of your journey will lead to success. To offer some inspiration, we’re sharing the story of Britt Hall—a professional who carved out a fulfilling career by embracing change, saying “yes” to opportunities, and staying true to their values.

Britt Hall’s career has been a journey of transformation, adaptability, and storytelling. She began in journalism, leading student newspapers and shaping narratives that connected communities. That passion for communication and culture led her into corporate environments, where she built internal communications strategies, fostered engagement, and helped organizations navigate change.

At Whole Foods Market, Britt played a key role in launching the 365 brand, designing team member experiences and driving internal culture. At National Instruments, she partnered with senior leaders to implement large-scale transformation and modern workplace initiatives. Now, at Cisco, she leads global enablement efforts, ensuring talent strategies empower people and teams to thrive.

Through every step, Britt’s work has been shaped by three guiding values: authenticity, accountability, and creative problem-solving. She remains dedicated to building meaningful experiences that drive impact.

# The First Steps: A Nonlinear College Journey
Britt Hall’s college experience wasn’t a straight path. In fact, it took nearly seven years to complete a bachelor’s degree. Initially pursuing music education and performance, Britt found themselves on an expected trajectory—until a single elective, “Storytelling and Puppetry,” reshaped their perspective. That class ignited a passion for storytelling, leading to a major shift into journalism and communications.

Switching from a music program meant starting over, even taking a step back to community college before transferring again on a journalism scholarship. These experiences taught Britt valuable lessons in resilience, adaptability, and trusting one’s instincts—skills that would prove crucial in their career.

# The First Job: Freelance, Hustle, and Saying Yes
Britt’s first job after college wasn’t handed to them—it was built through experience and opportunity. While freelancing for the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, Britt wore many hats: general assignments reporter, copy editor, and even interim archivist. At the same time, they worked as a barista, eventually taking on training and marketing roles for the coffee shop.

Three months after graduation, Britt secured their first full-time role in marketing and communications for the Corpus Christi Symphony Orchestra—an opportunity that came from an earlier internship. The key lesson? Keep doors open, maintain good relationships, and recognize that every experience (even in retail and food service) builds skills that matter.

# A Career Built on Passion and Adaptability
Fast forward to today, Britt leads a global team at Cisco, managing employee experience and enablement for hiring and internal talent movement programs. It’s a role that aligns almost perfectly with their Ikigai—the Japanese concept of purpose—combining passion, mission, vocation, and profession.

Britt’s journey from journalism to corporate leadership wasn’t accidental. It was guided by a mindset of embracing change, being willing to “figure it out,” and leveraging past experiences to build a unique and valuable career path.

# Advice for College Juniors: Be a Bricoleur
So, what advice does Britt have for students entering the workforce?
1. **Say yes now, figure it out later.** Opportunities don’t always come neatly packaged. Trust yourself enough to take on challenges, even when you don’t feel fully prepared.
2. **Build resilience.** The most adaptable and successful people share three traits: accepting reality, finding meaning in what they do, and improvising when necessary.
3. **Identify your values early.** Britt’s guiding principles—authenticity, accountability, and creative problem-solving—help in making decisions, setting boundaries, and maintaining work-life balance.
4. **Keep relationships strong.** The first full-time job came from an internship, and career growth often hinges on connections and a strong reputation.

# The Takeaway: Your Path is Yours to Make
Britt Hall’s career isn’t one of rigid planning—it’s a testament to adaptability, lifelong learning, and saying “yes” to the right opportunities. For college juniors feeling uncertain, the message is clear: your path doesn’t have to be linear. Trust the journey, embrace change, and build a career that aligns with your passions and strengths.
