# Meet Marta Texidor
Marta Texidor is currently the Director of Customer Success for Pharma and MedTech at Microsoft. Her career journey has been a remarkable one, driven by her passion for helping others achieve their goals and her unwavering commitment to personal growth. After initially interning as a software developer, she landed her first job as a software developer with Atos. Demonstrating her versatility, she later transitioned into a customer-facing role at Progress Software, honing her skills in customer relationships. Eventually, Marta found her calling at Microsoft, where she excelled as a Customer Success Manager, specializing in digital transformation within the Healthcare and Life Sciences sectors.

# The Call to Adventure: College and Beyond
Marta's journey started like many college students, with a dream and a degree. She graduated with a degree in Computer Science engineering and a thirst for knowledge. Her first job while she was still at school was a unique one - she became a private Math tutor. While it may seem unrelated to her eventual career in the tech industry, this role challenged her to find creative ways to make complex concepts understandable. Each student had their unique learning style, and Marta's adaptability helped her connect with them on a personal level.

Through a friend's mother, she secured her first job as a Java Developer. While she lacked experience, Marta's attitude set her apart. She embraced the opportunity to learn and welcomed feedback as a means to grow.

Marta leaves college students with a valuable piece of advice - there are no wrong turns, only unexpected paths. Your career journey may not follow a straight line, but what matters most is aligning your choices with your values. When you do that, everything else will fall into place.

> My biggest shift in thinking, coming from an engineering background, was that not everything is 1s or 0s, black or white. There is beauty in the ambiguity and the grey areas. Because it is not as defined as the extremes, you can play and find your own path and framework to work with.
