For college juniors preparing to launch their careers, the path ahead can feel both exciting and uncertain. How do you land that first job? What skills truly matter? How do you turn a job into a fulfilling career? To help answer these questions, we spoke with Dave D'Abate, a successful Account Executive whose career journey is proof that relationships, continuous learning, and adaptability are key ingredients for long-term success.

## Starting Strong: Lessons from the First Job
Dave’s career began at AT&T as a retail sales consultant. Like many fresh graduates, he started in an entry-level role, selling devices and services to both consumers and small business accounts. But what set him apart? His mindset. While others simply met expectations, Dave aimed higher—doubling his sales targets and positioning himself as a go-to resource and subject matter expert.

He quickly learned that success isn’t just about showing up; it’s about being proactive. “I had to put in the effort beyond what I witnessed from my colleagues,” he says. This willingness to go the extra mile became a defining trait in his career.

## Breaking into the Workforce: The Power of First Impressions
Landing that first job can be daunting, but Dave emphasizes the importance of energy, enthusiasm, and preparation. One piece of advice he received early on has stuck with him: “Every conversation you have is an interview.” From the very first screening call to the final handshake, the way you present yourself matters. Being able to articulate your work ethic and passion can make all the difference in standing out to hiring managers.

## Building a Career: Key Lessons and Mindset Shifts
Over the years, Dave has picked up several insights that have fueled his success:
- **Be willing to learn.** Taking the extra time to do something correctly now will set you up for success later.
- **Manage your business.** If something needs to get done, schedule time for it—otherwise, it won’t happen.
- **Adaptability is key.** You won’t always succeed on the first try, but the ability to adjust and improve will make you stronger.
- **Incorporate feedback immediately.** When someone offers guidance, show them that their investment in you is worth it by implementing changes right away.

## From College to Career: The Importance of Preparation
Dave admits that he wasn’t the best student in college—he spent more time hiking than studying. But he quickly realized that preparation is everything. “Studying in college is very similar to how one should prepare before any meeting,” he explains. Whether it’s a class or a client presentation, showing up unprepared is never an option. Observing how others operate and borrowing their best practices can help you refine your own approach over time.

## Final Advice for Students Entering the Workforce
Dave’s parting wisdom for students is simple yet powerful: “Always set aside time to continue investing in your success.” Seek out mentors who are invested in your growth, absorb their knowledge, and apply it. But never stop learning—if you ever find yourself as the smartest person in the room, it’s time to find a different room.

As you chart your own career path, remember that success isn’t a straight line. It’s built on hard work, adaptability, and the relationships you nurture along the way. Take a page from Dave D'Abate’s journey, and embrace every opportunity to learn and grow.
