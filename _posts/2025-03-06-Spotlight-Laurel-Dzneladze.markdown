The Sujeeth Foundation Spotlight highlights the stories of individuals who made the jump from academia to industry.  We share stories to inspire and educate.  We hope students can leverage this experience in their own journey.

Planning your career might seem daunting, but learning from those who have navigated similar paths can be both inspiring and insightful. One such story is that of Laurel Dzneladze, a dynamic professional at Microsoft whose journey showcases the power of adaptability, networking, and continuous learning.

# Finding Passion Through Experience
Laurel currently supports the Microsoft Viva Community and communication products, focusing on product marketing and go-to-market strategies. Her passion lies in how community and communications shape an organization’s success. Throughout her career, she has dedicated herself to building solutions that drive engagement, productivity, and overall success within companies.

Her career trajectory wasn’t a straight line, but each experience helped shape her professional path. Laurel's story is proof that discovering your Ikigai—the intersection of passion, mission, vocation, and profession—takes time, experimentation, and a willingness to explore different opportunities.

# From Internship to Full-Time Success
Laurel’s first job came as an extension of an internship at Johnson Controls, which transitioned into a full-time role after graduation. In this position, she was responsible for communicating large organizational changes and managing digital spaces like the company’s website and intranet.
Some of her most valuable lessons from this early experience included: 
- **Understanding organizational processes**—how to start and complete a project effectively.
- **Developing presentation and executive relationship skills**—key abilities that help in gaining visibility and trust.
- **Collaborating in a corporate environment**—learning how to navigate teams and work cross-functionally.

# Landing the First Job: A Lesson in Proactive Networking
How did Laurel secure her internship that led to her first job? It started with an unpaid marketing role at a performing arts foundation, where she dedicated just four hours a week. That experience gave her exposure to a network of professionals, including board members who later connected her with the internship opportunity at Johnson Controls.
Her journey highlights a crucial strategy:
> Start small, be proactive, and leverage networking opportunities. Even the smallest roles can lead to significant career breakthroughs when approached with the right mindset.
 
# Career Lessons and Mindset Shifts
Throughout her career, Laurel has embraced a mindset of continuous learning and adaptability. Here are some of her key insights:
1. **Share ideas early and often**—don’t be afraid to put your thoughts out there.
2. **Ask questions instead of disagreeing outright**—a great approach to constructive discussions.
3. **Observe and learn from leadership**—find role models whose work ethic and leadership style resonate with you.
4. **Look beyond your immediate team**—seek projects outside your role that expose you to new challenges and learning opportunities.
 
# Embracing a Nonlinear Path
Laurel’s college experience was anything but conventional. She started as a dance major in Kansas City, studied abroad for a year, then took time off before resuming college at 25 years old. She compressed 2.5 years of coursework into just 1.5 years, proving that determination and flexibility can reshape one's academic and career path.
 
This unconventional journey reinforced an important lesson: careers are not always linear. The skills and experiences you gain from varied paths can become assets in unexpected ways.
 
# Advice for College Students
If Laurel could give one piece of advice to students entering the workforce, it would be:
 
> Not every role needs to be your dream job, and not every company needs to be your dream company.
 
It’s okay to change your mind about your career direction multiple times. What matters is gaining clarity on what excites you and where you want to grow after spending time in the workforce.
