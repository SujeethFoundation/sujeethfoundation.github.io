As a college senior, I am preparing to graduate and enter the job market. I felt overwhelmed by finding a full-time job and was unsure where to start. My goal was to secure a full-time position before graduation in May, but I needed guidance on how to successfully navigate the job search process. My mentor helped me learn the importance of networking and interview processes. He also gave me feedback on my personal brand. I gained more confidence in my abilities and in navigating the job market. I have a few interviews coming up, and I am confident they will go smoothly because of this mentor.
