excerpt: My mentor told me to reach out to people in the companies that I’m interested in and to connect with them on LinkedIn. I immediately tried it with one company, HubSpot, and conveniently got an interview with them! The first one already happened and now I am onto the second round! I truly thank you!

One of my challenges that I faced was that I could not land interviews with companies that I was very interested in. I asked my mentor how to better myself and be more noticeable. My mentor told me to reach out to people in the companies that I’m interested in and to connect with them on LinkedIn. I immediately tried it with one company, HubSpot, and conveniently got an interview with them! The first one already happened and now I am onto the second round! I truly thank you, my mentor!
