## “I Don’t Know What I Want to Do”—Why That’s Exactly Where You Should Start

We get it. You're busy. You're tired. Maybe, deep down, you're skeptical that all this "self-discovery" stuff actually matters. You came for a job, not therapy.

Fair enough. But here’s the reality most people learn too late:

> **If you don’t know yourself, the world will decide for you—and probably get it wrong.**

### Why “I Just Want a Job” Isn’t Enough

Many students I mentor start with, “I just want a job—any job.” Understandable, but here’s the catch: that's survival mode, not a strategy. Without specificity, mentors, hiring managers, and networks can’t truly help you. They don't know how to connect you, advocate for you, or engage you in meaningful opportunities.

### You Don’t Need a Master Plan—You Need a Hypothesis

Identifying your ideal job isn't about perfection. It's about creating your best guess—a career hypothesis—and testing it in the real world. Consider:

- What problems energize you?  
- When do you feel most effective or fulfilled?  
- Where do your natural strengths show up?

These aren't just abstract questions; they're essential tools for finding jobs you genuinely enjoy.

### Balancing Exploration with Execution

Once you’ve formed a basic career hypothesis, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the next step: applying. Should you apply to everything? Only perfect matches? What if you’re still figuring things out?

That’s where a simple, consistent system helps. According to *TealHQ*, a platform for modern job seekers, your best bet is to apply to at least one job a day. But not randomly—strategically. Think of it like this:

- Start with a **base resume** that includes all your experience.
- Tailor it for each application by highlighting only the most relevant parts.
- Keep your focus **broad enough** to explore, but **specific enough** to explain why you're a fit.

It’s not about having it all figured out—it’s about making small, repeatable moves in a clear direction. You’ll learn faster, get feedback sooner, and increase your chances of finding a role that actually fits.

### What If You're Not Getting Interviews?

If you're applying consistently and not hearing back, you’ve reached a critical decision point: **pivot or persevere**.

- A **pivot** means refining or changing your hypothesis. This could mean exploring another interest that better matches current market needs or aligns more directly with your experience.
- **Persevering** means doubling down—looking for ways to gain relevant experience to support your current target. That might involve volunteering, earning a certificate, enrolling in a specialized course, or finding stretch opportunities in your current environment.

Both paths are valid. The key is to stay in motion and remain honest about what you're learning along the way.

### Personal Insight: Why I Walked Away from Law

When I started college, I planned to become a lawyer—drawn to the idea of community impact and public service. But the deeper I dove, the clearer it became that my strengths were in strategy and technology, not meticulous detail or adversarial environments. Had I not reflected honestly, I might have ended up unhappy, deep in debt, and unfulfilled.

Instead, I found a role at Microsoft, a nexus of my true interests: finance, technology, and sales. This alignment not only energized me professionally but validated my initial hypothesis—transforming interests into lasting passions.

### Clarity Creates Momentum

Specificity, even if it's tentative or messy, gives you a direction:

- It makes your applications compelling.
- It helps you articulate clearly during interviews.
- It mobilizes mentors and allies effectively on your behalf.

Specificity isn't limiting; it’s liberating. It opens doors through intentional serendipity. And remember, targets are flexible—tools, not traps.

### You’re Not Behind—You’re Just Early

At Career Circle, the goal isn't immediate answers. It's about fostering the space to ask better questions and discover meaningful insights. Exercises like the Coat of Arms, SMART goals, and career research aren't mere busywork—they're foundational tools that build your blueprint for success.

Because knowing yourself isn't a luxury—it's your greatest competitive advantage.

### Bottom Line:

You already have everything you need to build a fulfilling career. But the world won't hand it to you—you need to define it clearly.

So get curious. Ask the tough questions. Lean into reflection. You might be surprised by the doors it opens.
